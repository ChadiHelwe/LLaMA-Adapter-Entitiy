Nadim Ladki  AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06  Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday .  But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan .  China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .  Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .  The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time .  Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .  Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria .  Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .  It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes .  Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .  Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .  Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence .  Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did .  Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us .  The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . '  '  Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here .

But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan .  China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .  Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .  The former Soviet republic was playing in an [START_ENT] Asian Cup [END_ENT] finals tie for the first time .  Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .  Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria .  Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .  It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes .  Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .  Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .

AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06  Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday .  Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body .  It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes .  Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .  Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute .  Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal .  Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute .  A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot .  Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .  Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute .

BUCHAREST 1996-12-06  Romania trainer Anghel Iordanescu called up three uncapped players on Friday in his squad to face Macedonia next week in a World Cup qualifier .  Midfielder Valentin Stefan and striker Viorel Ion of Otelul Galati and defender Liviu Ciobotariu of National Bucharest are the newcomers for the European group eight clash in Macedonia on December 14 .  Iordanescu said he had picked them because of their good performances in the domestic championship in which National Bucharest are top and Otelul Galati third . ""  I think it 's fair to give them a chance , "" he told reporters .  League title-holders Steaua Bucharest , who finished bottom of their Champions ' League group in the European Cup , have only two players in the squad .  Attacking midfielder Adrian Ilie , who recently moved from Steaua to Turkish club Galatasaray , is ruled out after two yellow-card offences .  Squad :  Goalkeepers - Bogdan Stelea , Florin Prunea .  Defenders - Dan Petrescu , Daniel Prodan , Anton Dobos , Cornel Papura , Liviu Ciobotariu , Tibor Selymess , Iulian Filipescu .

1177testb CRICKET,27,"CRICKET - LARA ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY .  Robert Galvin  MELBOURNE 1996-12-06  Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday .  Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .  Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .  All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .  Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .  His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .  Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .  West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday .  He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .  The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle .  It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .  Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06  West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday .  Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .  The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .  West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat .  Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him .  As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .  On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .  Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday .  Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take .  Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper .  Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings .  Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago .

1208testb SOCCER,0,"SOCCER - [START_ENT] ITALIAN [END_ENT] FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND .  ROME 1996-12-06  Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT ) :  Bologna ( 4 ) v Piacenza ( 13 ) 1330  Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn .  Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday .  Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530  Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega .  Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer .  Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330  Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi .  Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930  Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups .  Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack .  AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330  Can Milan sink any further ?  Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .  Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield .  Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury .

Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330  In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala .  Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini .  Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330  Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago .  Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury .  Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals .  Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330  All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack .  The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle .  Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330  Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .  Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .

ROME 1996-12-06  Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT ) :  Bologna ( 4 ) v Piacenza ( 13 ) 1330  Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn .  Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday .  Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530  Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega .  Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer .  Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330  Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi .  Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930  Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups .  Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack .  AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330  Can Milan sink any further ?  Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .  Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield .  Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury .  Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330  In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala .  Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini .  Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330  Parma may field new signing , [START_ENT] Croat [END_ENT] midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago .  Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury .  Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals .  Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330  All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack .  The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle .  Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330  Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .  Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .  Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano .",[START_ENT] [END_ENT]
